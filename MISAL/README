MarcusCom Intelligent Socket Abstraction Library (MISAL)
--------------------------------------------------------

$Id$

MISAL is a multi-threaded Java library that allows for manipulation of TCP
sockets.  MISAL is designed to wrap around sockets and give an easy interface
to sending an receiving data on a socket.

MISAL itself is fairly generic, and can be used for almost any type of TCP 
socket.  It is mostly used for things like telnet.  MISAL knows about telnet
options, and will reply with DONT or WONT for all options.

MISAL can be extended to support all kinds of specific socket types as well
as specific network node types.  The default MISAL distribution comes with
Cisco IOS(tm) and Cisco Catalyst OS subclasses.

Right now, MISAL is considered to be beta-quality code.

MISAL is distributed under the BSD license.
