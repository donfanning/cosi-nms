This package is small extension to ciscoconf by jabley
(homepage: http://www.automagic.org/~jabley/ciscoconf-1.1.tar.gZ)
Orginally ciscoconfd and ciscoconfr are programs that allow full configuration
histories for Cisco routers to be maintained remotely. The configuration data
is stored in RCS format on Managment Station. This extension support
Catalyst 2924M-XL with ATM uplinks (fetchs configruation from switch board
and uplink module too and store in the same file). Those files
could saved ie. in /tfpboot directory for fastest loading back on RMA
or new router or Catalyst (IOS version only)

HOMEPAGE: http://www.automagic.org/~jabley/ciscoconf-1.1.tar.gz

Every user should customize ciscoconf.sh for they own needs.
Curretly this script logs to /var/log/cisco and store data in RCS
at /tftpboot/ directory.
