ABSTRACT:
---------
This file contains general information about the changes to MCR Viewer
that were involved in converting it to use an SQL server.


OVERVIEW:
---------
mcr_pusher.pl: Inserts call records into a MySQL database.

mcr_pusher.txt: The documentation for mcr_pusher.pl

mcr_viewerx.pl: The SQL using version of mcr_viewer.pl. This script
invokes mcr_view-01x.pl, mcr_view-02x.pl, mcr_elite.pl, and
mcr_total_servers.pl.

mcr_view-01x.pl: Gives a complete log of access to a certain NAS on a
certain day.

mcr_view-02x.pl: Gives a complete to date log of every record with a
certain user id or ip address.

mcr_total_servers.pl: Gives statistics on all of the NASs for a certain
day. Does not contain statistics on distributions.

mcr_elite.pl: This script gives statistics on a certain NAS for a
certain day. More verbose than mcr_total_servers, in that in contains
distributions for certain useful fields such as the SNR, connection
speed, disconnection reason, etc..


DESCRIPTION:
------------
There were several files that needed to be added and changed to allow viewing of
call record statistics using an SQL server. First of all, a database server
needed to be installed to house the records. We decided on MySQL. Secondly, a
script needed to be written which insert records into the database, and
mcr_pusher.pl was born. Documentation on mcr_pusher.pl can be found in
the file mcr_pusher.txt. mcr_pusher.pl can be used on several records at a
time or be single fed records.

All of the mcr_view files needed to be changed, so I kept the same naming
convention but added the letter 'x' to then end, for xperimental. mcr_viewerx.pl
has some added functionality. It must call the script mcr_elite.pl and
mcr_total_servers.pl. Otherwise, it is basically the same.

mcr_view-01x.pl has basically the same functional as mcr_view-01.pl. The results
are outputed in a table instead of in a preformatted blocked.

mcr_view-02x.pl also has the same functionality as the original script. It is
faster because it uses an SQL server with the ip and user_id fields indexed. It
also outputs results to a table.. with pretty colors..

mcr_total_servers.pl is the first of the two added features that give statistics
on the calls. It prints results for all of the servers, by server. The stats
include averages and maximums for the TX/RX Rate, TX/RX Characters, SNR,
Retrains, Time on, Dialpad, and number of bad frames. It allows you to pick
any date.

mcr_elite.pl is similar to mcr_total_servers.pl except that the statistics are a
little more verbose and are for a single server.
