<pre>Usage: aclmaker [-v] [-d dir] [-f file] {command} access-list-name

Manipulate Cisco access control lists on a session previously opened
on file descriptor 3.  Invoke via subshell from "telnet", "kermit" or other
Telnet client that allows subshell to inherit telnet session on fd3.

Options:
   -f file       # use "file" instead of same name as ACL
   -d dir        # use "dir" to store local copy instead of current dir
   -v            # verbose mode - show progress of all router operations

Advanced options:
    -b len      # change maximum buffer length [256k]
    -q          # quiet mode, only show errors
    -D          # turn on script debugging
    -E timeout  # set Expect timeout [10]
    -F fdnum    # use a different file descriptor (or device path)
    -V {1|2|3}  # turn on verbose Expect debugging

Commands:
    list [aclname]  # list out acl, or list names of all acls on router
    get   aclname   # copy acl from router to local file
    test  aclname   # send acl to router (with dummy name) and check for errors
    put   aclname   # tests acl, saves it to router if it has no errors
    del   aclname   # deletes acl from router
    list config     # print out router's running configuration
    get  config     # copy router's running configuration to local file
    cmd  IOS-CMD    # send arbitrary command to router and display results</pre>
