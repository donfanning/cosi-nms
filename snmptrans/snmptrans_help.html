<H2><A NAME="Purpose &amp; Scope">Purpose &amp; Scope</a></h2>

<P>The purpose of this tool is to provide users a way of translating object
IDs to object names and vice versa in a fast and easy manner.  Trying to do
such translations manually is time consuming, and susceptible to to errors
and confusion.</p>

<P>While this tool is useful, it does not teach a full understanding of
MIB syntax or MIB structure.  It does its best to condense the MIB to
show the important bits of the objects.  It also does not teach SNMP
fundamentals.  It is highly recommended that users understand the mechanics 
behind SNMP by reading other sources like 
<u>SNMP, SNMPv2, SNMPv3, and RMON 1 and 2</u> by Stallings.</p>

<P>This tool, while it does provide an interface to read MIBs,
does not cover how to compile those MIBs into various management applications.
For help and tips on compiling MIBs, please read the 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/app_notes/mib-compilers">
mib-compilers</a> document from Cisco Systems, Inc.</p>

<P>For help on determining what MIBs are supported on various Cisco devices, please
see the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/supportlists">
support lists</a>.  <B>NOTE: The support lists are not 100% accurate, and
should only be used as an initial reference.</b></p>

<H2><A NAME="User Interface">User Interface</a></h2>

<H3><A NAME="Inputs">Inputs</a></h3>

<P><Em>Object Identifier or Object Name</em> is an input that specifies the OID
or object name to translate.</p>

<UL>
<LI>It can be a fully-qualified OID (e.g. .1.3.6.1.2.1), a fully-qualified 
object name (e.g. .iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2), or a short object name 
(e.g. mib-2)<BR>
<LI>The leading '.' can be omitted (e.g. 1.3.6.1.2.1 or .1.3.6.1.2.1)<BR>
<LI>Object names are case sensitive.<BR>
</ul>

<P><Em>r.e.</em> is a checkbox that allows for regular expression and
"best-guess" pattern matching with object names.  By enabling this checkbox,
the tool will do a case insensitive, regular expression search for the
specified object name pattern.  All POSIX 1003.2 extendend regular expressions 
are supported.  For more information on regular expressions, and regular 
expression syntax, please see click <A HREF="re_format.html">here</a>.</p>

<P><Em>replace</em> is a checkbox that controls whether or not the MIB parser
should replace older loaded MIB objects with newer ones.  This can have the
positive effect of letting newer, more descriptive, objects float to the
top of the tree.  It can also have the negative effect of causing an
inconsistent hierarchy in the MIB tree.</p>

<UL>
<LI>Turning on regular expression support is a way to do case insensitive
translations.<BR>
<LI>Note that multiple matches are obviously possible, so the best result is 
currently calculated as the one that matches the closest to the beginning of
the node name and the highest in the tree.<BR>
<LI>Multiple indexes is not supported as a '.' is treated as a regular
expression metacharacter.<BR>
</ul>

<P><Em>Translate Options</em> are radio buttons that allow for determining 
the output for the translation.</p>

<UL>
<LI>A <Em>Simple Translation</em> will return a ``OID = object name'' or 
``object name = OID'' pair.  This is useful for getting a quick translation
for an object name or OID.<BR>
<LI><Em>Detail Output</em> returns a considerable amount of information
on an object.<BR>
<LI><Em>Tree Output</em> draws the MIB tree starting from the given OID
or object name.  This will be useless if a leaf object is given.  If an OID
or object is given that is high in the tree, the output will take a long
time to display.  <B>This output is the most useful for decoding unknown
traps or notifications.</b><BR>
</ul>

<P><Em>Search Pattern</em> is a text field that specifies a string to find
within the MIB tree.</p>

<P><Em>Search description</em> is a checkbox that enables support for 
searching object descriptions.  With this checked, both object
names as well as their descriptions will be searched for the given pattern.
Without this option, only the object names are searched.</p>

<UL>
<LI>The search pattern can be a simple string (e.g. <CODE>apple</code>), or 
a POSIX 1003.2 compliant extended <a href="re_format.html">regular
expression</a>
(e.g. <CODE>.*voice.*qual.*</code>)<BR>
<LI>The search pattern is case insensitive.<BR>
<LI>Depending on how complex the search pattern is, the search may take a long
time to return.  The more complex the pattern, the shorter the wait will be.
<BR>
</ul>

<H3><A NAME="Actions">Actions</a></h3>

<P><Em>Translate</em></p>

<UL>
<LI>This will run the translation on the given inputs.
</ul>

<P><Em>Find Objects</em></p>

<UL>
<LI>This will run a search using the given search pattern.
</ul>

<H2><A NAME="Interpreting Results">Interpreting Results</a></h2>

<H3><A NAME="Sample Output 1">Sample Output 1</a></h3>

<P><Em>Source:</em> This output is obtained by doing a simple translation of
<CODE>ciscoStackMIB</code>.  The output will display <CODE>ciscoStackMIB</code> 
and the corresponding OID for that object.</p>

<PRE>
ciscoStackMIB = .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.5.1
</pre>

<P><Em>Understanding:</em> <CODE>ciscoStackMIB</code> is the short object name 
that needs to be translated.  The object identifier for this object is 
<CODE>.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.5.1</code>.</p>

<!--
<H3><A NAME="Sample Output 2">Sample Output 2</a></h3>

<P><Em>Source:</em> This output is obtained by doing a simple translation of
<CODE>.*stack.*</code> with the r.e. checkbox checked.</p>

<PRE>
ifStackTable = .1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2
</pre>

<P><Em>Understanding:</em> The regular expression <CODE>.*stack.*</code> 
says, "match zero or more of any character, followed by the word stack, 
followed by zero or more of any character."  Using the rules stated above, 
this will match the node highest up in the tree, and closest to the beginning 
of the node.</p>

<P><Em>Understanding:</em> The OID <CODE>1.3.6.1.2.1</code> at the top 
of the output denotes the object identifier for the parent node of this tree.
The colors in this output are important.  Everything colored 
<FONT COLOR="green">green</font> is a branch node.  Clicking on those
objects will redraw the tree starting at that point.  Everything colored 
<FONT COLOR="#DC00DC">magenta</font> is a leaf node.  Clicking on those objects
will reveal detail on the object.  Also, clicking on the <FONT COLOR="#DC00DC">
<SMALL>detail</small></font> link will reveal detail about a branch node.</p>

<P>The <CODE>----</code> next to leaf nodes represents the access of those 
nodes.  <CODE>-R--</code> refers to read-only access, <CODE>-RW-</code> 
refers to read-write access, <CODE>CR--</code> refers to read-create access, 
and <CODE>----</code> indicates the object is not accessible.</p>

<P>The number in parenthesis next to the object name refers to the object's
subid in the tree.  For instance, the <CODE>(4)</code> next to 
<CODE>sysContact</code>, indicates that sysContact is system.4.</p>

<P>Traps and notifications have the word <B>Trap</b> preceeding them in 
bold-face.  To find traps or notifications quickly, do a search for "Trap" 
using your browser's page search capability.</p>

<H3><A NAME="Sample Output 3">Sample Output 3</a></h3>

<P><Em>Source:</em> This output is obtained by doing a detailed translation
of <CODE>rttMonThresholdNotification</code>.</p>

<PRE>
.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.42.2.0.3
rttMonThresholdNotification OBJECT-TYPE
        -- FROM CISCO-RTTMON-MIB
        TRAP
        VARBINDS        { rttMonCtrlAdminTag, rttMonHistoryCollectionAddress, rttMonCtrlOperOverThresholdOccurred }
        DESCRIPTION    "A rttMonThresholdNotification indicates the 
       occurrence of a threshold violation for a RTT operation,
       and it indicates the previous violation has subsided for
       a subsequent RTT operation.  Precisely, this has resulted
       in rttMonCtrlOperOverThresholdOccurred changing value.  
  
       When the RttMonRttType is 'pathEcho', this 
       notification will only be sent when the threshold
       violation occurs during an operation to the target and
       not to a hop along the path to the target.  This also
       applies to the subsiding of a threshold condition.

       If History is not being collected, the instance values 
       for the rttMonHistoryCollectionAddress object will not 
       be valid.  When RttMonRttType is not 'echo' or 'pathEcho'
       the rttMonHistoryCollectionAddress object will be null."

</pre>

<P><Em>Understanding:</em> The OID at the top of the output denotes the object
indetifier for this node.  The next line displays the short object name for
this node, and indicates that this node is an OBJECT-TYPE.  The next line
tells what MIB that this object can be found in. The next line indicates what 
type of object this node is.  In this example, a Trap object is being 
displayed.  Other types include, OCTET STRING, Counter, Gauge, TimeTicks, 
IpAddress, Opaque, OBJECT ID, NetAddress, Null, BitString, Counter64, 
NsapAddress, Integer, and UInteger.</p>

<P>Since this object is a trap, a list of variable bindings, or varbinds is
provided.  Varbinds are sent along with the trap to further describe why
the trap was sent.  In this example, three varbinds are sent with the trap.
Clicking on a varbind name will yield details about that varbind.</p>

<P>The <CODE>DESCRIPTION</code> field is taken directly from the object's
definition within the MIB.  The final piece of information shows where in the
MIB tree this object can be found.</p>

<P><Em>Understanding:</em> This output shows the matching objects based
on the search pattern given.  All objects have a detail link next to them
that will provide a detailed translation on the given object.  If the object
is a branch node, the tree link will be active.  Clicking on that link will
produce a tree starting from the given branch node.  If the object is a leaf
node, the tree link will be greyed out.</p>
