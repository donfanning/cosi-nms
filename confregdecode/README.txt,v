@cisco Systems IOS(tm) Config-Register Decoder Readme
----------------------------------------------------

$Id: README.txt,v 1.3 2001/05/27 22:20:40 jmarcus Exp $

Requirements:
-------------

* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.1.5 or higher
* Windows or UNIX operating system (FreeBSD recommended)
* 32 MB or RAM
* Color monitor with display set to 256 or more colors

Installation (From Java Source):
--------------------------------

* Unpack the confregdecode-src-1.2.1.tar.gz or confregdecode-src-1.2.1zip file 
(both contain identical contents)
* Change directory to the confregdecode-src-1.2.1 directory.
* On UNIX, edit the Makefile so that all the paths are correct, and type
``make jar''.  You will need javac (the Java compiler) 1.1.5 or later.
On Windows, you may not be able to use the Makefile.  If not, type
``javac com/marcuscom/confregdecode/ConfregDecode.java''
* On Windows, run confregdecode, on UNIX, run ./confregdecode.sh

Running in Applet Mode:
-----------------------

A ConfregDecode.html file is distributed along with the Configuration
Register Decoder Package.  This HTML file can be used as a template to
invoke the applet version of the tool.  The Configuration Register Decoder
jarfile has both the code necessary to be an applet or application.  No
extra compilation is required.

Notes:
------

* More on the Cisco IOS(tm) configuration register can be found at
http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/iaabu/distrdir/dd4700m/vconfig.htm
* This program contains code written by David Flanagan.  All code is
distributed under the BSD license except where noted in the header.
